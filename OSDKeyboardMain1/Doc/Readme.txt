ColeType 
v1.0.3
Author: Manu Tyagi


Description:

ColeType is a tool that allows the user to learn touch typing for Qwerty, Dvorak and Colemak
Keyboards as they continue to work freely on their computers. The main functionality provided is an
onscreen keyboard that displays the user input via animation of the keys pressed.

The keyboard remains on top of all other windows and there for allows the user to check what key to click 
and stops the user from habitually looking down at their actual keyboard to encourage proper touch typing
form.

The application also allows a selection of customisation option to tailor the look and feel of the onscreen
keyboard to their preference and to best be integrated into their workspace.
